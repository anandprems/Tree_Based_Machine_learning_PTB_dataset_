# Tree_Based_Machine_learning_PTB_dataset_
The primary objective of this particular paper is to classify the health-related data without feature extraction in Machine Learning, which hinder the performance and reliability. The assumption of our work will be like, can we able to get better result for health-related data with the help of Tree based Machine Learning algorithms without extracting features like in Deep Learning. This study performs better classification with Tree based Machine Learning approach for the health-related medical data. After doing pre-processing, without feature extraction, i.e., from raw data signal with the help of Machine Learning algorithms we are able to get better results. The presented paper which has better result even when compared to some of the advanced Deep Learning architecture models. The results demonstrate that overall classification accuracy of Random Forest, XGBoost, LightGBM and CatBoost, Tree-based Machine Learning algorithms for normal and abnormal condition of the datasets was found to be 97.88%, 98.23%, 98.03% and 95.57% respectively.
